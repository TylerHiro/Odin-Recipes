        <li>3 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>3 pounds chicken wing drumettes</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place yellow onion, habanero peppers, green onions, lime juice, soy sauce, garlic, fresh thyme, brown sugar, oil, salt, black pepper, allspice, dried thyme, cinnamon, cumin, and nutmeg into a blender. Blend until marinade is completely smooth.</li>
  <li>Place chicken drumettes into a large bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and toss to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.</li>
  <li>Arrange chicken evenly on the prepared baking sheet; reserve marinade in the bowl.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the reserved marinade onto chicken, then turn over. Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Turn chicken over and brush with remaining reserved marinade. Continue baking until tender and caramelized, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Rest chicken on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a serving platter.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: You can marinate the wings for 2 hours at room temperature, turning every 15 minutes, instead of marinating in the refrigerator overnight.</em></p>
